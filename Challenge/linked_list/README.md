# Singly Linked List
There is just one pointer referring to the next node in each list node. To traverse the list, typically a head pointer is required, and the traversal can only proceed forward.

## Challenge
Create a Node class with properties for the Node's value as well as a pointer to the next Node. Include a head attribute in your LinkedList class. An empty Linked List should be produced when the object is instantiated. Create methods for inserting, checking for inclusion, and listing nodes in the LinkedList class.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)<br>
Space: O(n)

## API
Create a Node class with properties for the stored value as well as a pointer to the next node.
Create a Linked List with all of the properties listed below:

- adds the includes() function, which returns a boolean if a value is included in a list.

- adds the insert() method, which can be used to create a new node with the specified data ll-insertions.

- to string 
- append
- insert_after
- insert_befor



## Tasks checklist:
- [x] insert method
- [x] includes function
- [x] Create a Node class
- [x] Create a LinkedList class 
- [x] Create an append method
- [x] insert_after method
- [x] insert_befor method
